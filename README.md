# 2048

This repository contains a Python implementation of the popular 2048 puzzle game using the Pygame library. The game is
played on a 4x4 grid, where the player combines tiles with the same number by moving them in four directions (up, down,
left, or right). The objective is to reach the elusive 2048 tile by merging tiles and achieving the highest possible
score.

# How to Play

- Use the arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) to move the tiles in the respective direction.
- When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one, and the score increases.
- The game is lost when there are no more valid moves available, and the board is filled.

# Requirements:

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library
